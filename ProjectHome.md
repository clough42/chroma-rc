ChromaRC is an open-source hardware controller for LED lighting on RC aircraft.  It controls four separate channels of PWM-dimmed common-anode RGB LED strips as well as two separate single-color channels for landing and orientation lights.  It also provides two RC channel inputs for control and configuration, two DIP jumpers, also for configuration, as well as battery voltage monitoring.
